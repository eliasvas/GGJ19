# GGJ19
This is a game made by me (programming) my brother (art) and a friend of mine (audio/SFX) for the Global Game Jam 2019. The game was 
made in about 42 hours. In this repository there is the hole project including the art/animations/code/music. If you just want to play
the game go ahead and download the zip "home_away.zip".
